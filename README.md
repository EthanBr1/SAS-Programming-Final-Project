This repository contains the code for my Statistical Programming Final Project.

In this project, SAS was utilized to manipulate and analyze smoking and surgery data provided by the instructor. Multiple visualizations and tables were created to represent the data. T-test was conducted to determine a significant difference in age at death between non-smokers and smokers. One-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD were conducted to determine significant difference in age at death by race.
